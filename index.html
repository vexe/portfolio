                    Was my dream project... How I got started in video games. <br><br>
                    IOU was meant to be a love letter to Classic Survival Horror. 
                    Started all the way back in 2012 by Nic the artist, I then joined. We had no idea what we were doing. 
                    Couple of passionate fools purely fueld by nostalgia.
                    Did all the text-book indie mistakes, rewrote things a million times, 
                    hopped engines a thousand times. Lot of burnout and emotion, 
                    work would be put on hold, then resumed, then on hold again.<br><br>
                    In 2020 I decided to give it a final go now that I have real experience making and shipping games. 
                    I implemented all the systems and mechanics of the game in Unreal and I was pumped, 
                    but due to some unfortunate circumstances, I had to cancel the project and move on. 
                    Make use of the game systems in other projects. It was hard, we were both too attached and 
                    obsessed with this project, it wasn't healthy. We definitely bit more than what we could chew, 
                    turns out making an RE clone is not so trivial afterall.<br><br>

                    This is a 3D game engine for lowpoly games. Written in C/C++ from scratch. It features a software renderer with z-buffer and triangle sorting support, object culling, triangle clipping, perspective-correct and affine texture mapping.<br><br>
                    The collision system used ellipse-based detection, where objects are represented as an ellipse and then shrunk down to a sphere to simplify math and do collision detection and handling. I used a simple grid for broadphase.<br><br>
                    The animation system is skeletal-based bone-weighted key-framed implementation.<br><br>
                    The asset pipeline used an offline step to convert models/images using Assimp to an internal engine format.<br><br>
                    Platform layer (Win32) was written from scratch which gave the game input handling via Xinput, audio mixer using DirectSound, and would blit and stretch on screen the game's 640x480 or whatever size pixel buffer. Game state was separate from engine and compiled into a DLL which is loaded dynamically from the engine for hot-reloading support.<br><br>
                    Prerendered backgrounds are implemented by populating the depth-buffer with the prerendered depth before rendering the scene:

                    OpenGL 3D engine with MD2 model animations, DLL hot-reloading, funky shaders, and an entity inspector that uses reflection/introspection to inspect data and modify values.<br><br>
                    A preprocessor runs in a pre-build step, scans source code files and generates reflection code that the engine uses. The code contains metadata information about the types, field names, field types, and getters/setters and type constructors.<br><br>
                    TODO: Post code on github. But first, figure out how this thing builds again Lol.<br><br>

                    <b>fRED aka "Fuckin' Right Editor"</b> is a custom-tailored text/code editor for my personal use and coding style.<br><br>
                    I was fed up with how slow Visual Studio is, and how cumbersome it is to customize other 'lightweight' editors to <I>perfectly</I> fit your needs. I also wanted to prove to myself that I can finish projects not just small demos. <br><br>
                    One of my more serious projects, written  in 'sane' C/C++, uses gap buffer for the text data-structure, and Dear Imgui for the rendering backend. It has a fast custom lexer for C-type languages, syntax highlighting, instantanious text and symbol searches, macro recording, super smooth scrolling, split views, an inspector for changing themes and properties, and much more.<br><br>
                    I plan to put it on github at some point...<br><br>

                    One of my most useful tools I made for work.<br><br>
                    
                    It's a C++ utility that uses Dear Imgui for the interface, and UDP sockets to
                    communicate with Unity clients. The idea is to be able to connect into running builds or editors and inspect memory, get
                    state dumps, execute commands, etc. The possibilities are endless on what you could do. We have multiple games and each
                    one of them uses its own cheat tool and editors. This can unify all that.<br><br>
                    
                    Data is communicated from/to C# to/from C++ via a custom written reflective binary serializer.<br><br>
                    We mostly use it for console development to send commands to the game.<br><br>
                    
                    I also use it to mess with Greg our QA guy and send random console logs to his editor "SYSTEM CRASH OUT OF MEMORY
                    PZZERRRRRP" lmao.<br><br>
